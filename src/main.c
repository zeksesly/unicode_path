//Create a program that finds all the shortest paths between all the islands,
//using informationabout the bridges that connect them. 
//The program:
//•reads data from a file. Its name is specified as a command-line argument
//•finds all the shortest paths between each combination of two islands
//•prints the paths using the FIFO (first) rule for the islands to the standard output.
//More examples can be found in the CONSOLE OUTPUT

//Input file description:
//•the first line in the file is the number of islands
//•the remaining lines describe the distance between the two islands
//Input file description:
//•the first line in the file is the number of islands
//•the remaining lines describe the distance between the two islands
//island1-island2,length_of_bridge
//–the names of the islands contain only alphabetic characters and cannot be emptyor identical
//–the length of the bridge contains only numbers, cannot be empty and has a positivevalue
//–the sum of the lengths of all bridges in the file does not exceed INT_MAX

//The output consists of information blocks about a specific shortest path. 
//Each block contains:
//•======================================== - the upper boundary that consists of 40=  characters
//•Path: <island1> -> <island2>t hat shows the initial point and the final destination
//•Route: <island1> -> <all_islands_between> -> <island2> that shows the full routebetween the two islands
//•Distance: <length1> + <length2> = <sum> that shows the distance between everyisland in the route, as well as their sum that indicates the distance to the finaldestination
//•======================================== - the bottom boundary that consists of 40=  characters
//Error handling.
//The program prints errors to the standard error streamstderrin thefollowing order of priority

// •usage: ./pathfinder [filename]if there is an invalid number of command-line arguments
// •error: file [filename] does not existif the file does not exist
// •error: file [filename] is emptyif the file is empty
// •error: line 1 is not validif the first line contains something other than digits orhas a non-positive value
// •error: line [line_number] is not validif one of the remaining lines does not matchthe format above
// •error: invalid number of islandsif the number received in the first line does notmatch with the number of islands
// •error: duplicate bridgesif there is more than one bridge between the islands
// •error: sum of bridges lengths is too bigif the sum of the lengths of all bridges inthe file exceeds INT_MAX
